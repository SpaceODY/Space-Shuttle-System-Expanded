# Space Shuttle System Expanded

### Information

DESIGNED FOR KSP RO/RSS 1.8.1-1.10.1 (May work on other versions)

MODS REQUIRED: ASET (Core, Avionics, Rover props), JSI(Raster prop monitor), KSPWheel, B9PartSwitch

All the space shuttles except challenger went through a livery update in 1998. This changed the flag placment and added the NASA meatball on its left wing. I implimented this into the mod with a 1980 varient and a modern varient on all the shuttles. Only exception is challenger which only lasted 9 missions before flying its fatal 10th for STS-51L on January 28th, 1986.

Installation: 
1. Remove any previous versions of Space Shuttle System from GameData
2. Put the folder named "SPACE_SHUTTLE_SYSTEM" and "RealismOverhaul" into your KSP Gamedata.
4. ???
5. PROFIT

If you want to try the HD Textures (WIP) bring the folder named GameData inside of it and overwrite anything that comes up.


If you have any quesitons for me, contact me in the KSP discord server. My name is NASA Fan or SpaceODY in it.

## Known Bugs

### Shadows

Scatterer, even on the very high preset, has shadow errors on the shuttle cargo bay.

To fix this, go to the space center and click on scatterer ->  Customize Settings -> Shadows -> Long-Distance terrain shadows and input the following:

- Shadow cascade splits: 0.002,0.005,0.015


### Missing parts (Enginemount primarly)

- I remember this issue occuring to me a long time ago but I have never had it since. I don't know how this problem occurs due to it functioning just fine for myself. If any of you figure out why this occurs and how to fix it please open an issue about it.
