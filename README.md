Thanks to Decq for creating this mod in the first place.

I did not create any of the 3D models for this mod. I simply changed textures and subtypes in configs.

All the space shuttles except challenger went through a livery update in 1998. This changed the flag placment and added the NASA meatball on its left wing. I implimented this into the mod with a 1980 varient and a modern varient on all the shuttles. Only exception is challenger which only lasted 9 missions before flying its fatal 10th for STS-51L on January 28th, 1986.

WARNING: Highly suggested to backup your current SPACE_SHUTTLE_SYSTEM folder if you have one.

Installation: 
1. Remove any previous versions of Space Shuttle System from GameData
2. Bring everything over from the download's gamedata folder and overwrite the configs in RealismOverhaul
3. ???
4. PROFIT
