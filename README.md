MADE AND DESIGNED FOR KSP RO/RSS 1.8.1-1.10.1 (May work on other versions)

MODS REQUIRED: ASET (Core, Avionics, Rover props), JSI(Raster prop monitor), KSPWheel, B9PartSwitch, Realism Overhaul

MODS SUPPORTED: Kerbalsim, TACLifeSupport(From regular RO), Waterfall.

Thanks to Radar for making this a community mod so we can work on keeping it up to date together.

Thanks to Decq for creating this mod in the first place.

Thanks to DylanSemrau for his version of SpaceShuttleSystem.

Thanks to vevladdd for getting waterfall support for this mod.

Thanks to Al2Me6 for the templates on the RCS and SSME (Waterfall)

Thanks to giuliodondi for his public configs for SSS.

Thanks to D0m1nu2 for Kerbalism Configs.

I did not create any of the 3D models for this mod. I am simply making realistic time period textures and keeping this mod up to date until KSP2 Releases.

All the space shuttles except challenger went through a livery update in 1998. This changed the flag placment and added the NASA meatball on its left wing. I implimented this into the mod with a 1980 varient and a modern varient on all the shuttles. Only exception is challenger which only lasted 9 missions before flying its fatal 10th for STS-51L on January 28th, 1986.

WARNING: Highly suggested to backup your current SPACE_SHUTTLE_SYSTEM folder if you have one.

Installation: 
1. Remove any previous versions of Space Shuttle System from GameData
2. Put the folder named "SPACE_SHUTTLE_SYSTEM" and "RealismOverhaul" into your KSP Gamedata.
3. OPTIONAL: If you want to use Dylan's aerodynamics copy and paste the contents of his aerodynamic folder into gamedata and overwrite it.
4. ???
5. PROFIT

If you want to try the HD Textures (WIP) bring the folder named GameData inside of it and overwrite anything that comes up.


If you have any quesitons for me, contact me in the KSP discord server. My name is NASA Fan or SpaceODY in it.

Future plans:
- Hubble Space Telescope
- Kerbalism support built in
- Fixing UVs on some parts
- HD textures

V1.5 Release
- Brought SSS back up to date with most recent RO (14.0.0-14.6.0)
- Used giuliodondi updated configs for SSS
- Kerbalism Support Added (Thanks to D0m1nu2)
- SIDE NOTE: If tanks do not have helium added to them, you may need to replace the parts with new ones.

V1.5 PRE RELEASE
- Brought SSS back up to date with most recent RO (Should be 14.6)
- Used giuliodondi updated configs for SSS

- (WIP) Optional HD textures folder (Currently only for cabin on select shuttles)

V1.4 PRE RELEASE
- Added new payload bay texture (Removed height maps on it for now)
