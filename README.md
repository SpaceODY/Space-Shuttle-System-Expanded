Thanks to Decq for creating this mod in the first place.
Thanks to DylanSemrau for his version of SpaceShuttleSystem.

Thanks to vevladdd for getting waterfall support for this mod.
Thanks to Al2Me6 for the templates on the RCS and SSME (Waterfall)

Shuttle Fixes are implemented from Raiz Space. Check out his youtube channel with this link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeHMXQRT6D3o2sbfsqkpCcA

ROE-Waterfall can be found here: https://github.com/vevladdd/ROE-Waterfall

I did not create any of the 3D models for this mod. I am simply making realistic time period textures and keeping this mod up to date until KSP2 Releases.

All the space shuttles except challenger went through a livery update in 1998. This changed the flag placment and added the NASA meatball on its left wing. I implimented this into the mod with a 1980 varient and a modern varient on all the shuttles. Only exception is challenger which only lasted 9 missions before flying its fatal 10th for STS-51L on January 28th, 1986.

WARNING: Highly suggested to backup your current SPACE_SHUTTLE_SYSTEM folder if you have one.

Installation: 
1. Remove any previous versions of Space Shuttle System from GameData
2. Bring everything over from the download's gamedata folder and overwrite the configs in RealismOverhaul
3. ???
4. PROFIT
